# CC_segmentation
Utilizing the K-Means algorithm for credit card customer segmentation:

* Developed a model to effectively categorize credit card customers, aiding the company in refining their marketing strategies.
* Analyzed a sample Dataset encompassing the spending patterns of approximately 9000 active credit card holders over the preceding 6 months.
* The dataset is organized at the customer level and incorporates 18 distinct behavioral variables.
* Employed the K-Means algorithm, with the optimal number of clusters determined through the silhouette score.
* Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, leading to enhanced visualization.

### Output


* **Cluster 0:** Within this customer group, a significant number of individuals exhibit low balances, engage in limited spending (low purchase frequency), and possess the lowest credit limits.

* **Cluster 1:** This particular customer cluster comprises a smaller portion of the total. These customers maintain moderate balances, frequently engage in substantial spending (high purchase frequency), and hold the highest credit limits.

* **Cluster 2:** Another minor subset of customers falls into this cluster, characterized by elevated balances and cash advances, infrequent purchase activities, and considerable credit limits. It's plausible to infer that this segment employs their credit cards akin to loans.
